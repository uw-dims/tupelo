   discover device (disk) parameters via the HDIO_GET_IDENTITY ioctl,

   By inspection of result buf, looks like

   buf[20-33] = serial num (14), may be whitespace-padded internally.
   buf[54-68] = manufacturer, model (what scsi INQUIRY calls 'VendorID'??)

   Note: fails on a usb external drive. scsi INQUIRY worked on this device,
   so might be a better choice since works with more drive types??
