Packages needed:
squashfs-tools


ISO files are read only, so you have to extract the files, make modifications, then repack it back into an ISO
You should only need to extract the ISO once. All the modifications are to the squashfs file in the next section.


Extracting:

# Create a mount point and mount the ISO
mkdir iso
sudo mount -o loop <SOURCE>.iso iso
# Create a folder for storing the extracted files
mkdir extracted
# Copy everything
cp -r iso/ extracted
# Unmount
sudo umount iso

The Caine ISO uses a squashfs file as the filesystem, which is yet another read only FS
The file is 'casper/filesystem.squashfs'
Modifing this requires the 'squashfs-tools' package

Resources:
http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/80305/mounting-a-squashfs-filesystem-in-read-write

Extracting the FS:

mkdir ~/work
cp filesystem.squashfs ~/work

# BACK UP THE ORIGINAL SOMEWHERE
mkdir ~/backup
cp filesystem.squashfs ~/backup

# Exctact the FS
cd ~/work
# Run this as root to prevent any permission errors
sudo unsquashfs filesystem.squashfs
# Twiddle thumbs, get coffee, or do something while this is chugging away
# Note: Uncompressed is 2.5x larger (5.5GB vs 1.8GB compressed)

Make any changes you want

Changes I made:
Installed tupelo files under /opt
Added the bin/ folder tot he path in /etc/environment
Added the caine user to the disks group via /etc/groups (This allows the user to access /dev/sda and so on without elivated permissions)

MAKE SURE THAT PERMISSIONS ARE CORRECT. squashfs preserves the permissions as they are

Repack the FS:
# If the old filesystem.squashfs is still there, mksquashfs tries to apply your
# changes against the original. This creates duplicates of most directories
# Just delete the old one to force the creation of a new file
rm filesystem.squashfs
sudo mksquashfs squashfs-root/ filesystem.squashfs


Replace the original filesystem.squashfs with the new modified version
Rebuild the ISO:
mkisofs -o ../caine-tupelo.iso -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat 
-no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -J -R -V "Caine - Tupelo" .


Create bootable USB however you want (I usually use unetbootin)

FOR FASTER TESTING:
Once you have a bootable USB made, just update the filesystem.squashfs file on the drive. No need to re-create the ISO or anything
