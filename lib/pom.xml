  <!--
      This pom is purely a vehicle for copying Tupelo 3rd party
      dependencies for users that DO have them built/installed into
      this directory so that they can be added to git for users that
      do NOT have them built/installed.  It is NOT part of the Tupelo
      codebase build process.  We do NOT have the Tupelo super-pom for
      a parent.  Conversely, the parent pom does NOT list us as a
      module.

  <!--
      This pom uses a profile named 'repo' to copy the dependencies
      listed below into the current directory (actually, under
      target/dependency, the default for the dependency plugin).

      Without this profile being activated, this pom acts on behalf of
      the non-power user, and the package phase installs the required
      jars+poms into the user's local repo (via use of the install
      plugin).  Note how in the install plugin configuration, we have
      to supply exact pomFiles to be installed alongside the jar.
      Without this, the pom found in the jar itself is NOT correctly
      copied into the final repos, so dependency info is lost.  This
      is a known bug for the install plugin 2.5.2, see
      http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MINSTALL-110.

      We use the dependency plugin's unpack-dependency goal to put the
      required poms onto the local filessytem. All very ugly!
